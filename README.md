# Project Description

This is an agent-based simulation for competitive Pokémon battles. Each agent in the simulation is a player, with a team. These agents are matched either randomly or by their Elo ranking, based on the pool of players available. 
The framework used can be used to implement any turn-based two-player game. In addition to Pokémon, Rock Paper Scissors is also implemented with appropriate agents.
